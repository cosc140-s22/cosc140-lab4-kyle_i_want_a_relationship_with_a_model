## Homework feedback

 * How long did you spend on this lab?
  I was able to finish the lab in two classes
 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?
  I thought this was a good lab. I definitely like object based programming more than the other type. This makes more intuitive sense to me.
